# Cryptocurrency client

This project was made for learning purposes only, no guarantees are made for stable functioning.

This is a study project simulating simple cryptocurrency clients for a made up currency. All clients run on a single machine and communicate over a simulated network, representing multiple separate clients on the internet.

To run this, either download the zip with the built app from the [releases](https://github.com/dzivko1/cryptocurrency-client/releases/latest) section, or clone the repository with IntelliJ IDEA and execute the `run` gradle task.
